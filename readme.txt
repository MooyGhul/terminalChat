Please note when finishing the chat, after first people enter "!", the second people must enter "!" after seeing the notice.

I design it this way to make the conversation ends smoothly (Both person will know what's happening).

Note:
Both will see 

    "********************************\n"
    "TALKING DONE! LEFT SUCCESSFULLY\n"
    "********************************\n"

and the program is closed successfully.
